### How to Get the Most Out of This Repo

So i tried to make this repo super beginner-friendly.

The notes are written in a really simple way (no fancy jargon unless of course necessary!), so definitely start there. They're actually useful and not boring!

The code is pretty well commented too. I made sure to explain the tricky parts. Give the code a read to see how things work!
